# Multi-agents_Prison_Dilemma_Simulation
Based on Complex Adaptive System(CAS) theory from Holland in the book "Hidden Order",  we try to apply this complexity theory to stimulate multi-agents prison dilemma in different situations

"agent.py" is a class of game agent, which define many features of every agent.
"main.py" define the main game process and the visualization program
